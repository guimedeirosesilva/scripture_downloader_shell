# Welcome to Scripture Downloader (SHELL)

### Greetings
This is a simple **console app** that downloads specific wav files for bible verses reading found on jw.org in **Portuguese**.

### Setup
This app uses the module **PyDub** for audio manipulation. **PyDub**, in turn, uses the **FFMPEG** library behind the curtains. **So, in order for the __"Scripture Downloader"__ to work you need to have the FFMPEG library installed.** 
So simply downloading the code above will **NOT** do the trick.

Please follow the instructions to install the FFMPEG Library: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows
You can download the FFMPEG Library on https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Also, this goes without saying, but you need **python** and **django** in order to run it.


### How to use the app
- Type in each line a scripture address you wish to download
(ps: this only downloads audios from nwt-T)
- Use the following scripture address structure:
- [bible book] [chapter as a integer]:[verse blocks] (notice the space between the bible book and the chapter)
  - The verses should be divided using "," (comma) or "-" (hifen). If the verse block if formed by consecutive verses and only 2 verses in length, preferably use ","; if it's bigger than 2, use "-". You can divide multiple verse blocks using ",". 
  - Example:
    - ✗ Mateus capítulo seis versículo 9 e 8 e depois dos versículos 25-33. 
    - ✓ Mateus 6:9,8,25-33
- Each scripture must have verses inside only one chapter. Examples:
  - ✓ Mateus 6:28-33 
  - ✗ Mateus 6:28-33; 7:1-2 (for that, type in separate lines)
- You can separate verses with a comma, but they need to be in chronological order.
(and please, try not to write way too complex verses)
- Press Enter twice to start downloading
- The audio files will be downloaded automatically in the folder output
- Do not under modify the file in the "input" folder.
